## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Clean Waters goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Clean Waters goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#clean-waters).

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
