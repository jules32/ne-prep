## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Livelihoods sub-goal

This folder contains scripts that prepare data layers used in the Livelihoods sub-goal (one half of the Livelihoods & Economies goal).

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#livelihoods-and-economies).

There are three scripts in this folder:  
1. `clean_noep_data.Rmd` cleans the raw data from the [National Ocean Economics Program](http://www.oceaneconomics.org/)  
2. `jobs.Rmd` creates the jobs layer from the cleaned NOEP data  
3. `wages.Rmd` creates the wages layer from the cleaned NOEP data

The `data` folder holds the cleaned up NOEP data (`clean_noep_data.csv`).

The `int` folder holds intermediate data for jobs and wages that may be useful to examine how the layers are created. These are mainly saved here for possible use in the dashboard.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
