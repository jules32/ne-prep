## Ocean Health Index Northeast: Sea Surface Temperature Pressure Layer

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the sea surface temperature pressure layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

For [data prep see this file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohi-northeast/d70fe6fa/prep/pressures/sst/sst_pressure_layer.html).

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
